Since the past year, the world has been fighting against the COVID-19 onslaught. No single country has survived this deadly virus, not even the holy city of Tanis, and vaccination seems like the only solution ahead. To efficiently manage citizens and hospitals in this sacred city, you have been approached by the Pharaohs from the Ministry of Family Health and Welfare for designing a software application called COVIN (any resemblance to real-life systems is completely unintentional) that allows for a streamlined procedure to citizens, hospitals and officials to manage this difficult task.

Your application has two chief stakeholders, citizens and hospitals. First, the hospitals should register themselves on the portal and upload their slots, which the citizens can avail themselves of. Each slot must store information such as the day of the slot, the vaccine given in that slot, the available quantity for that slot. Secondly, the citizens should register on the portal and look up different vaccination slots based on hospitals available in a particular area or administering a specific vaccine. They should be able to book slots for that hospital and query the portal for their vaccination details such as vaccine administered and due date of next vaccine.

Each citizen can register themselves only once, and they must provide their name, age, and a unique ID. Due to the shortage of vaccines, the government only allows vaccination of people above 18 years, so please make sure that no one under 18 can register. The hospitals also need to register themselves on the portal to vaccinate people. They must provide their name and Pincode and will be allotted a unique id.

The COWIN portal must have details of citizens, hospitals and vaccines available on the portal. Vaccine information such as the name of the vaccine, the number of doses, and the gap between the doses must be added to the COVIN portal before the hospitals can add slots for these vaccines. Once the slots are added and booked by the citizen, it is assumed that he/she gets vaccinated immediately. Make sure that for a particular day and hospital, the number of citizens registered for that slot does not exceed the maximum available slots, and the chosen slot does not violate the stipulated duration between slots.

The Pharaohs are well aware that building a GUI system takes too much time, and they are ready to accept a command-line version of the software. You must use Object-Oriented programming concepts taught in the lectures for your implementation. A detailed description of the functions that your app must implement is provided to you below along with a sample run of your app.

Different tasks to perform:

1. Add Vaccine:

Input: Name, Number of total doses required, Gap Between Doses Output: Display the added vaccine details

2. Register Hospital:

Input: Name, Pincode

Output: Display the added hospital details along with the generated unique hospital ID (A 6 digit number)

3. Register Citizen:

Input: Name, Age, Unique ID (A 12 digit numeric ID like Aadhar ID) Output: Display the citizen details and set his/her vaccination status as “REGISTERED.”

4. Create Slots:

Input: Hospital ID followed by the number of slots that the hospital wants to add. For each slot, enter the day number and quantity followed by selecting the vaccine for that slot.

Output: Display the details of the added slot.

5. Book a Slot:

Input: Unique ID of the citizen followed by 2 options to search: {By Pincode, By Vaccine}. A successful search should show a list of possible hospitals. Upon selecting the chosen hospital, their available slots must be reflected, and a chosen slot must be booked.

Output: Display the citizen vaccinated along with the vaccine. Change the status of the citizen to PARTIALLY VACCINATED/FULLY VACCINATED accordingly.

6. Slots available with a hospital

Input: Hospital ID

Output: List all slots for the chosen hospital
